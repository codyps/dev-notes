Title: Extending perf to support POWER's 24x7 counters
Presenter: Cody P Schafer <cpschafe@us.ibm.com>


== One Line Summary ==

How we're extending perf event alaises in sysfs and the perf userspace tool
event parsing to support parameterized events to allow greater flexibility in
perf event specification.

== Abstract ==

POWER 8 provides a new set of in-memory counters called 24x7 that are more
flexible than existing PMU events and behave in ways not concieved when perf
(the subsystem and the tool) were originally designed. Rather writing
registers to configure PMUs to collect certain events and then reading
registers to aquire the counts, 24x7 accumulates all counts it supports in
memory all the time. As a result, cross cpu count reads become "normal" and
viewing transactions as a scheduling concern no longer makes sense.

Additionally, 24x7 does per-guest event accumulation at the hardware level and
allows (properly authorized) guests to retrieve both physical level events and
the event counts of other guests.

As a result of this increase in flexibility, the 'cpu' parameter to
perf_event_open() (currently the only even parameter), becomes insufficient.
We also want to specify physical chips, cores, cpus, and the chips, cores and
cpus on other guests. We've slightly extended both the contents of sysfs event
aliases and perf tool's event specification to allow per-event
parameterization which is distinct from the 'cpu' argument.

Future work could address the more generic-transaction meaning and the lack of
a meaningful "cpu" for each perf event to be bound to.
