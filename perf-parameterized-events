We need perf to understand some additional data in it's aliases

Parsing of:
	pmu.c : struct pmu pmu->aliases
		struct perf_pmu_alias alias->terms

pmu.c		pmu_aliases()
		\-> pmu_aliases_parse()
		 \-> perf_pmu__new_alias()
parse-events.c	  \-> parse_events_terms()
		   \-> parse_events__scanner(str, &data, PE_START_TERMS)
parse-events.l	   |\-> parse_events_lex_init_extra(PE_START_TERMS, &scanner)
parse-events.l	   |\-> parse_events__scan_string()
parse-events.y	    \-> parse_events_parse();
			%%
			BEGIN(config) // suplimental


			-> parse_events_term__str(&term, PARSE_EVENTS__TERM_TYPE_USER, $1, $3)
			\-> new_term(term, PARSE_EVENT__TERM_TYPE_STR, PARSE_EVENTS__TERM_TYPE_USER, $1, $3, 0)

		And it gets added to the term.

pmu.c		perf_pmu__check_alias()
		\->pmu_alias_terms()
		 \-> parse_events_term__clone()

/*
"alias" = the stuff under /sys/bus/event_source/devices/*/events/*, commonly seen as "events".
	they are a series of "term_name=value" and "term_name" seperated by
	commas (see the definition of term_name below). Values can be numbers
	or strings, with some limitations (cannot be one of the "special_name"s).

The _contents_ of the /sys/bus/event_source/devices/*/events/* file is called  "terms"

Also appears to refer to the "term_name" portion shown above, which are looked up under /format.

Too many conflicts.

/* Namespace mixing:

"Forbidden words as values"

-------

ISSUES:
	- is_event_supported()
		- assumes that callers will have all info
		- assumes that .config1 and .config2 can be 0 and not change the event

parse_events_add_pmu() fails with simulated sysfs.
	- perf_pmu__check_alias()?


"term" - can contain event-aliases, base-terms, and format-terms
"event-alias" - a name which maps to a set of terms (excluding other event-aliases)
"base-term" - config[12] and bit slices
"format-term" - defined under /format, resolve to base-terms
