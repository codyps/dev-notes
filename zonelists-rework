pg_dat_t currently embeds an array of struct zonelist s (not pointers).
length of array is MAX_ZONELISTS.

What does zonelists_mutex protect?
	- "Global mutex to protect against size modification of zonelists as well
	   as to serialize pageset setup for the new populated zone."

	mm/page_alloc.c::

	Held around __setup_per_zone_wmarks();
		- Sets zone->watermark[WMARK_MIN], [WMARK_LOW], [WMARK_HIGH]
		- Calls setup_zone_migrate_reserve(zone);
			- calls (read) min_wmark_pages(zone) 
			- calls (read) get_pageblock_migratetype(page)
			- calls (write) set_pageblock_migratetype()
			- calls (write) move_freepages_block()
			
		- Calls calculate_totalreserve_pages();
			- reads zone->lowmem_reserve[j] where j = 0..MAX_NR_ZONES
			- sets zone->dirty_balance_reserve
			- sets globals dirty_balance_reserve and totalreserve_pages
	
	Held around build_all_zonelists(NULL, NULL) in numa_zonelist_order_handler()
		- 

	kernel/cpu.c::

	Held around build_all_zonelists(NULL, NULL) in cpu_up
		also has an interesting conditional in calling build_all_zonelists(NULL, NULL).
	
	mm/memory_hotplug.c::
	Held around build_all_zonelists(NULL, zone)
	Held around walk_system_ram_range(...)
	Held around zone_pcp_reset(zone)

All callers of build_all_zonelists() ensure they are holding zonelists_mutex.
	build_all_zonelists() does:
		set_zonelist_order();
		checks if system_state == SYSTEM_BOOTING, if it does, then call
			__build_all_zonelists(NULL) directly.
		otherwise, stop_machine(__build_all_zonelists, pgdat, NULL)
		set vm_total_pages = nr_freepagecache_pages()
		set page_group_by_mobility_disabled based on vm_total_pages & pageblock_nr_pages.
		Printks.

Do any zonelist users sleep?

nr_free_pagecache_pages() = nr_free_zone_pages(gfp_zone(GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE))

nr_free_zone_pages offset =
	where zonelist = node_zonelists(numa_node_id(), GFP_KERNEL)
	sum zone->present_pages - high_wmark_pages(zone)

walk_system_ram_range() uses find_next_system_ram(&res, "System RAM"). It
screams "some one screwed this up", string comparisons for ram ranges seems
extremely questionable.
