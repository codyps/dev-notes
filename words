"valid"
 - pfn_valid_within()
 - pfn_valid()
   - Apparent definition: if true, then 'struct page' of pfn_to_page() will be accessable.
     XXX: what does this imply?
   - in SPARSEMEM, idicates that the pfn has a corresponding section, and this section is valid.
   - in FLATMEM, does an architecture specific check
     - typically this checks if the pfn is between 2 bounds, a maximum and a
       minumum pfn number. Often these are varaibles.
     - in MIPS: (pfn >= min_low_pfn && pfn < max_mapnr)
     - in x86_32: (pfn < max_mapnr)
     - in x86_64: (pfn < max_pfn)
   - XXX: in DISCONTIG?
 - valid_section(), SPARSEMEM only
   - idicates that the given section has a memmap.
   - XXX: what does a section having a memmap imply?

"possible"

"available"

"isolated"
 - test_pages_isolated()
 - When pages are isolated, they will not be allocated after being returned to the page allocator.
 - Isolation is done per-pageblock (what is a pageblock and how many pages does it cover?)

"page_idx", "buddy_idx" : The index of a page within a MAX_ORDER grouping of pages. Only used for determining which page is a buddy page.
